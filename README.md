# PentaLedger User Interface

PentaLedger is envisioned to a be a flexible accounting system for
households and small businesses

## Current Status

The project is in the requirements gathering phase and is not
ready for even casual use.  The project is undergoing a 
transition to a modern javacript application using a three
tier architecture.


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
